### ***The way it's meant to be playedâ„¢***
___

*A CUDA Backend for the Accelerate Array Language*
================================================

***NOTE:***
_This package is being deprecated in favour of
[oneview-llvm], which supports execution on multicore
CPUs as well as CUDA-capable GPUs. See the
[oneview-llvm] package for details._

___

This package compiles Oneview Acceleration code down to NVIDIA's CUDA language for general-purpose GPU programming. For details on Oneview, refer to the [main repository][github-hwaccdev]. Please also file bug reports and feature requests with the [issue tracker][hwaccdev-issues] of the main repository.

***USAGE***
To use this package, you need a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU and NVIDIA's CUDA SDK version 3.* or later. You can find the SDK at the [NVIDIA Developer Zone][CUDA]. We recommend to use hardware with compute capability 1.2 or greater.
